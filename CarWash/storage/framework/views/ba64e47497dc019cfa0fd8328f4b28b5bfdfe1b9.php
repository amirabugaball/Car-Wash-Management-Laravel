                                <p>Carz Car Wash is unique in that we are a “Flex” service car wash. What that means to
                                    you is that we are the only car wash you will ever need. At Carz, our approach
                                    combines the latest car wash technology with the human touch to provide the best car
                                    wash experience possible.

                                </p>
                                <p>What you need when you need it. Choose from a basic “Express” exterior car wash to a
                                    complete “Showroom” detail package or anything in between. All done expertly and
                                    with the highest quality soaps and waxes.

                                </p>
                                <p>We believe in making customer satisfaction a top priority. We are vehicle owners just
                                    like you and we understand that it can be a stressful experience to trust your
                                    vehicle with someone else. At Carz, you can rest assured that we will treat your
                                    vehicle as if it was our own. We wash one vehicle at a time, so we can make sure
                                    each vehicle receives the best treatment possible.

                                </p>
                                <p>Amenities. We know you are busy, so we strive to provide you with a comfortable and
                                    productive space while you wait. All our locations have comfortable lobbies and
                                    outside seating areas with free Wi-Fi access, free popcorn and free premium coffee.
                                    We also vend snacks, drinks and car care products for your convenience.

                                </p>
                                <p>Safe for the environment. We are environmentally responsible as we believe it is the
                                    right thing to do. We reclaim and reuse our water, we use the latest technology to
                                    save energy, and we dispose of our waste responsibly. Plus, all our soaps and waxes
                                    are designed to be environmentally safe, while maintaining the highest standards of
                                    quality for your vehicle.</p>
